## Programming environment
In this course, we use the following development environment. Please set up your environment to do Python programming, following the below introduction.
* Python 3.x
* Jupyter (IPython Notebook) on Google Colaboratory

For your convenience, we use [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/), where we can easily use Python and Jupyter.
If you are familiar to do Python programming on your local environment, it's OK to use them rather than Google Colaboratory.
If so, please skip the following section about Google Colaboratory.

### Initialization of Google Colaboratoy
If you have never used Google Colaboratory, visit [the Google Colaboratory website](https://colab.research.google.com/).
Once you visit the website, you can find **the blue link about New Python 3 Notebook** on a menu.
Please click it.
Then, the website will show a screen for Python coding.
If you can see the screen, Google Colaboratory has been enabled for you!


### How do you enjoy hands-on coding in this lecture?
Click each links on section "Content list" on this page (e.g. [User-based collaborative filtering](https://colab.research.google.com/github/trycycle/recommender-system-2020/blob/main/notebook/1c-user-based-cf.ipynb?hl=en)). 
Then, you will see hands-on materials on Google Colaboratory.

Almost all codes are ready to execute.
Just click the execution button on Google Colaboratory to see what happens when codes run!
