## Programming environment
In this course, we use the following development environment. Please set up your environment to do Python programming, following the below introduction.
* Python 3.x
* Jupyter (IPython Notebook) on Google Colaboratory

For your convenience, we use [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/), where we can easily use Python and Jupyter.
If you are familiar to do Python programming on your local environment, it's OK to use them rather than Google Colaboratory.
If so, please skip the following section about Google Colaboratory.

### 1. Initialization of Google Colaboratoy
If you have never used Google Colaboratory, visit [the Google Colaboratory website](https://colab.research.google.com/).
Once you visit the website, you can find **the blue link about New Python 3 Notebook** on a menu.
Please click it.
Then, the website will show a screen for Python coding.
If you can see this screen, Google Colaboratory has been enabled for you!

Next, please move to [the Google Drive website](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/my-drive) to prepare material for this lecture.


### 2. Make a directory for this lecture on Google Drive
For this lecture, we store data and Python codes on Google Drive.

After enabling Google Colaboratory in the step 1, the Google automatically makes the directory **Colab Notebooks** on Google Drive.
Let's make a new directory for this lecture in the Colab Notebooks directory.
First, download a zip file from [my GitHub repository](https://github.com/trycycle/recommender-system-2019/archive/master.zip) and unacrhive the zip file.
Then, bring the unarchived directory (name is **recommender-system-2019**) into the ``Colab Notebooks`` directory on your Google Drive.


## How do you conduct your programming assignment in this lecture?
In this lecture, I assume that you will write Python codes on the ``Colab Notebooks/recommender-system-2019`` directory on your Google Drive and run the codes on Google Colaboratory.

In the lecture, follow me and make a directory for coding.
The following describes how to make a directory:

1. Move on to ``My Drive/Colab Notebooks/recommender-system-2019`` directory on your Google Drive.

2. Click the **New** button on the left-upper corner on the Google Drive website and choose **Google Colaboratory** in the **More** menu.

3. Then, Google creates a new notebook for Python coding. Set an appropriate notebook name on the created notebook.
